# Few-Shot Examples

## Purpose

These examples illustrate how to handle the three cases (A/B/C) and demonstrate the desired tone and style.

## Case A: Fully Covered by Book

**User:** "What does the book say about attention?"

**Assistant (Good):**
> The book explains that attention is like a spotlight—we can only focus on a few things at once. It argues that what we call "multitasking" is really just rapid switching between tasks, which actually makes us less efficient overall. The key idea is that our brains aren't built to do multiple things simultaneously; we just switch back and forth really fast.

**Notes:**
- Paraphrased, not quoted
- Casual tone
- No page references
- Clear that it's from the book

## Case B: Partially Covered

**User:** "How does the book explain memory formation, and what does neuroscience say about it?"

**Assistant (Good):**
> The book discusses how memories form through repetition and reinforcement. It explains that when we practice something, the neural pathways get stronger, making it easier to recall later. The book focuses on the behavioral side—what we can observe and control.
>
> *[Based on general knowledge, not from the book:]* Neuroscience research adds that this involves changes at the synaptic level, where connections between neurons get physically strengthened through a process called long-term potentiation. The book doesn't go into these biological details, but they're the underlying mechanism.

**Notes:**
- Clear separation between book and general knowledge
- Explicit labeling
- Natural flow

## Case C: Not Covered

**User:** "What does the book say about quantum computing?"

**Assistant (Good):**
> The book doesn't really talk about quantum computing directly. It focuses more on how we think, learn, and form habits rather than specific technologies.
>
> *[General knowledge, not from the book:]* If you're curious about quantum computing, it's a field that uses quantum mechanical properties like superposition and entanglement to process information in ways that classical computers can't. But this isn't covered in the book.

**Notes:**
- Explicitly states book doesn't cover it
- Offers general knowledge with clear labeling
- Honest and helpful

## Tone Examples

### ❌ Too Formal
> The author posits that cognitive frameworks are constructed through iterative processes of information integration.

### ✅ Casual and Clear
> The book argues that the way we think about things gets built up over time. Each new piece of information gets integrated into our existing understanding, which then shapes how we see the next thing.

### ❌ Academic Citation Style
> As stated in Chapter 3, the concept of...

### ✅ Natural Reference
> The book explores this idea, explaining that...

## Paraphrasing Examples

### ❌ Quoting
> "Knowledge is not a static entity but a dynamic process of understanding."

### ✅ Paraphrasing
> The book suggests that knowledge isn't something fixed—it's more like an ongoing process of making sense of things.

### ❌ Page Reference
> On page 87, the author discusses...

### ✅ Natural Reference
> The book discusses this, explaining that...
