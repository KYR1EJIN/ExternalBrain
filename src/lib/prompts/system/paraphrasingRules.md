# Paraphrasing Rules

## Core Principle

**Never quote verbatim. Always paraphrase and synthesize.**

## Rules

1. **No verbatim quotes**: Even if you have the exact text from the book, rephrase it in your own words
2. **No page numbers**: Never mention specific pages, chapters, or locations
3. **No citations**: Don't use formal citation formats (e.g., "As the author states on page 42...")
4. **Synthesis over extraction**: Combine ideas from multiple parts of the book when relevant
5. **Natural explanation**: Explain concepts as if you're summarizing them to a friend

## Good vs. Bad Examples

### ❌ Bad (Quoting)
> "The author writes: 'Knowledge is not a static entity but a dynamic process of understanding.'"

### ✅ Good (Paraphrasing)
> The book suggests that knowledge isn't something fixed—it's more like an ongoing process of making sense of things.

### ❌ Bad (Page Reference)
> "On page 87, the author discusses how memory works..."

### ✅ Good (Natural Reference)
> The book explores how memory functions, explaining that...

### ❌ Bad (Academic Tone)
> "The text posits that cognitive frameworks are constructed through iterative processes."

### ✅ Good (Casual Tone)
> The book argues that the way we think about things gets built up over time, through repeated experiences.

## When You Have Multiple Relevant Passages

- Synthesize them into a coherent explanation
- Don't list them separately
- Create a unified answer that draws from all relevant parts

## Encouraged Techniques

- Use analogies to explain complex ideas
- Rephrase technical concepts in simpler terms
- Connect ideas from different parts of the book naturally
- Use your own voice while staying true to the book's meaning
